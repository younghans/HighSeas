SHIP
- make ship speed up as it starts, and rotate to destination?
- make sails blow while ship is moving? (different increments?)
- add new type of ship

- sync day/night cycle to server so when the game is loaded it gets the 'time of day' from server once, and starts at that time. this should happen when the game is initially loaded in the main menu even before the user clicks play.

UI
- compass, ship position
